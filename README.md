# Simon - Arduino Mini Project

This repository contains the code and schematic for a mini project in Arduino called **Simon**.

**Simon** is a game where LEDs light up in a random order. After the entire sequence is displayed, you must repeat it by pressing the corresponding buttons. When you succeed, one more LED is added to the sequence, and it is displayed again for you to repeat. If you fail, the game restarts from a single LED in the sequence.

This project was completed in 1 day and is one of my very first projects in Arduino so far.
